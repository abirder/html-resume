<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>

<h2>Some of my many interests include:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I'm an avid sports fan. I love all of the (former) Oakland, CA teams: the Raiders, A's and Warriors. I also heavily follow European and international soccer.</li>
    <li>I love trying new restaurants. I recently moved to San Francisco, CA, and there's so much to explore here. I like to try new foods, but at the same time, I love trying the same item at multiple restaurants â€“ I'm on a quest to find the best patty melt in the city.</li>
    <li>I'm a big fan of board and card games. Since college my favorite card game has been Egyptian War. I also enjoy Catan, and Texas Hold'em.</li>
